# (Hacky!) Parallel Stellar Core Catchup

## Background

### Goal

Sync a full Stellar validator node (including full history) as fast as possible.

### Problem

A full catchup takes weeks/months â€“ even without publishing to an archive.

### Idea

 * Split the big ledger into small chunks of size `CHUNK_SIZE`.
 * Run a catchup for the chunks in parallel with `WORKERS` worker processes.
 * Stitch together the resulting database and history archive.

## Usage

```
./catchup.sh LEDGER_MAX CHUNK_SIZE WORKERS
```

If you need to start from scratch again you can delete all docker-compose projects:

```
for PROJECT in $(docker ps --filter "label=com.docker.compose.project" -q | xargs docker inspect --format='{{index .Config.Labels "com.docker.compose.project"}}'| uniq | grep catchup-); do docker-compose -p $PROJECT down -v; done
```
